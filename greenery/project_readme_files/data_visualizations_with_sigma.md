Do demonstrate the usefulness of the data stack, here are a few example Sigma visualizations, comprised of dashboards intended to be used by executive leaders, as well as tables of data for deeper dives by specific business units.

<h3>Product Funnel Dashboard</h3>

- This dashboard illustrates the stages in Greenery's user web sessions by quanitfying the number of users moving from step to step in the product funnel. It also explains the number of users lost at each layer of the funnel. The dashboard features easy to use filters, this report is designed to be analyzed each quarter.

<h3>Product Popularity Chart</h3>

- This chart shows the current popularity of products over their entire lifetime, with color formatting to indicate levels of popularity.

<h3>Warehouse Order Sheet</h3>

- This table is the Greenery warehouse order sheet. It is intended for a warehouse manager to see a comprehensive list of all current orders that need to be prepared and shipped out to customers. They could print out this report and walk the warehouse as they verify that the correct orders have been prepared and are ready to ship. The table includes consignee names, delivery addresses, list of products ordered, total piece counts, and even a warehouse delay counter which indicates how many days the order has been delayed. Note that since the data shows the orders were placed in February of 2021, we are pretending like the date the report was pulled on is February 13th, 2021.

<h3>Marketing Report</h3>

- This filterable table is designed for use by the marketing team. The goal here is to see a list of customers who made accounts with Greenery and either ordered once, or didn't order at all. These users are potential ad campaign targets where Greenery could send them discounts. The State geography column is also added so the marketing team can send "Plant Care Materials" and "Guides" for taking care of their Greenery plants in their regions. By increasing customer engagement with one-time and no-time ordering customers, we increase the potential to convert them into return customers.
